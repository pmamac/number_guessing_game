This project allows the user to guess a number with the range of 1 to 100.
* Rules: the number must be between 1 or 100, otherwise a message will show up that says: Please enter a number between 1 or 100!
* After guessing the correct answer the some statistical information will be provided (mean, median, and mode).
* The game will also ask the user if they wish to play again, otherwise a thank you message will you up.
* A greeting message in four different langauges is shown at the start of each game.
* After the player enters the "n" value they will be thank for playing the game with their name. Example: "Thank you for playing Paul!"
*  If the player provides a non-numerical response a ValueError message will appear that says: "Hmm...Something went wrong please try again!:("
